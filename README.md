# matrix-dbms-manifest
Matrix data storage manifest based on (n^n)^(n^n) where each data pairs with subdata blocks in all index probability.


Over time, databases deviate from desired features and performance. Any action to remedy this situation will one day turn primitive techniques into a costly deception to advance. As a result, I am sharing the manifesto of a data management system that has been re-planned beyond the techniques and developments made in the past, is dependent on the development of humanity, and will respond to all kinds of needs in line with endless possibilities.

Before we move on to the manifesto, we need to talk about the problems. These problems are:
- Inability to use large chunks of data as desired
- Preventing data integrity as a result of central data storage insistence
- Inability to collect required data for IoT and AI as desired
- Expensive data storage and lack of parallel data flow
- Unpredictable query times
- Indexing and searching slowness of 2D databases
- And the sub-titles of these titles...
